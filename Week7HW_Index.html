        	<h2>About the book</h2>
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<p>"From 1965 to 1995, the Grateful Dead flourished as one of the most beloved, unusual, and accomplished musical entities to ever grace American culture. The creative synchronicity among Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann, Mickey Hart, and Ron "Pigpen" McKernan exploded out of the early 60s roots and folk scene, providing the soundtrack for the Dionysian revels of the counterculture."</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"Dennis McNally, the band's historian and publicist for more than 20 years, takes listeners back through the Dead's history in A Long Strange Trip. McNally not only chronicles their experiences in a fascinatingly detailed fashion, but veers off into side trips on the band's intricate stage setup, or the magic of the Grateful Dead concert experience. McNally carries the Dead's saga through the 70s and into the more recent years of constant touring and incessant musical exploration. Written with the same zeal and spirit that the Grateful Dead brought to its music, the book takes listeners on a personal tour through the band's inner circle, highlighting its frenetic and very human faces. A Long Strange Trip is not only a wide-ranging cultural history, it is a definitive musical biography." - Amazon.com </p>
